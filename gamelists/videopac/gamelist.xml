		<name>Air-Sea War / Battle (Europe, US)</name>
		<desc>Variations

1 – Air-Sea War, Rear Guided Shots: A two-player game in which one player takes on the role of an aircraft, while the second takes on the role of a submarine. Both players move automatically in opposite directions across the screen, but their speed and altitude/depth can be adjusted using the joystick. Pressing the fire button launches a shot from the rear of the aircraft or submarine, which can be “guided” somewhat after launch by pushing left and right on the joystick. The winner is whoever has the most points after three minutes. A point is gained for hitting the other player, and lost for hitting the two “neutral” ships that move across the middle of the screen.

2 – Air-Sea War, Rear Unguided Shots: As above, but the shots cannot be guided after launch.

3 – Air-Sea War, Front Guided Shots: As variation 1, but the shots launch from the front of the aircraft and sub rather than the rear, requiring different timing.

A – Battle, Basic Game: A two-player game in which each player controls a tank from a top-down perspective by pushing left and right on the joystick to turn, up to move forwards and the fire button to fire a shot. Each player must destroy their opponent as many times as possible within a 3 minute time limit. Each player has 20 rounds of ammunition; the game ends early if both players deplete their stocks. In order to let players know when they are nearly out of ammunition, their last three shots are a different colour.

B – Battle, Basic Game with 2 Barriers: As above, but there are two impassable “barriers” on the screen that cannot be moved or fired through.

C – Battle, Basic Game with 10 Barriers: As above, with a more complex arrangement of barriers.

D-F – Battle, Guided Missiles: As A-C, but the direction of shots can be changed after they are fired by steering your tank.

G-I – Battle, Mines: As A-C, but mines are present on the map. Driving into these destroys your tank and gives your opponent a point.

J-L – Battle, Pro-Tier 1337 Noscope: As A-C, but the direction of shots can be changed after they are fired and there are mines present.

		<desc>At the start of a game the player in control of the ball selects the kind of play (pass, punt or run) and the second player attempts to predict which one they chose. If the defensive player predicts correctly, the Offense will undergo a penalty on any yardage gained if and after that play is successful. Following any successful play, the players see the position at which the Ball Spot exits the screen (in the case of a punt or a pass play) and the Offense draws a card. Most cards have a mini-map of the playing field and will designate the total of yardage gained depending on where the Ball Spot left the screen.

		<name>Baseball (Europe, US)</name>
		<desc>Baseball! follows basically the official rules of the real game. The three numbers on the scoreboard at the lower left side of the screen indicate Balls, Strikes and Outs, in that order. Players on defense can control the outfielders with the joystick. During the pitch, the joystick will control the ball's curve.
Once the batter hits the ball, the defense has to try to catch it. A ball caught on the fly is an automatic out. If it isn't caught, the outfielders have to catch it and send them to the fielders using the action and the directional stick to the desired direction.
A ball not caught on the fly will send the batter automatically to the first base. He can run to extra bases using the directional stick. A ball hit out of the park (the white line at the top of screen) is a home run and the batter will run all four bases automatically.
Three outs make teams exchange positions. The game length is nine innings, with additional innings in case of ties.

		<name>Flipper Game (Europe, US)</name>
		<desc>Variations

1-4: The standard game at its normal speed with 1-4 players taking turns.
5-8: The standard game played in “slow motion” with 1-4 players taking turns.

Flipper Game is a simple pinball simulation, with its main gimmick being the fact it is possible to move the flippers at the bottom of the screen left and right to a small degree.

Pulling the joystick back and releasing fires the ball, with the length of time the joystick is held determining the power. The ball then bounces around the screen-size “table”, and the player may move the flippers left and right slightly with the joystick, or activate them both simultaneously by pressing the button.

Points are scored by hitting the various bumpers around the table, which change colour and make a sound when they are hit. Launching the ball into the “spinner” in the middle adds to a bonus counter, which is added to the player’s score when the ball drains. The most points are acquired by hitting the “knockdown” targets at the top of the screen — represented as thin, coloured lines — but these are hard to hit as the spinner often gets in the way.

Each player gets five balls with which to score as many points as possible. Play alternates between participants whenever a ball is drained, with the current player being indicated by a number on the left of the screen and the colour of the playfield frame. At the end of a multiplayer game, each player’s score is displayed in sequence so you can see who “won”. There is no high score facility, however.

		<name>Golf (Europe)</name>
		<desc>Variations

There are no real “variations” on this game; pressing 1-4 on the keyboard indicates how many players are participating. Rather than following the format of real golf, each player takes it in turns to play a complete hole, and is represented by a different colour.

In Golf, players have free control over their golfer as they walk around the course, which is represented a hole at a time from a top-down perspective. The angle of the golfer’s club changes according to their relative position to the ball, and holding the joystick’s button starts a backswing, always in a clockwise direction. The angle the ball will travel will thus be calculated according to where the club was when the backswing started.

The longer you hold the button, the more powerful the swing, but if you allow the backswing to go all the way around, the power of the shot will be randomised. Upon landing the ball on the green, the display switches to a zoomed-in view, where the same control scheme is used for putting. After sinking the ball (achieved simply by causing the ball to overlap the hole graphic — there are no “near misses” in this game) you move on to the next or, in a multiplayer game, the next player gets to take their turn.

The game runs for 9 holes, each of which has a unique layout, but the only hazards besides the course’s shape itself are trees.

		<name>Gunfighter (Europe)</name>
		<desc>Variations

There are no variations for this game — pressing any key on the keyboard starts the game. The game can be played with one or two human players — after starting the game, if one of the controllers isn’t touched, the computer will take over control of that gunfighter. In fact, if neither of the controllers are touched, the computer will take over control of both for a “zero player” demonstration mode.

Two gunfighters — one blue, one pink (alternatively black or white respectively if the computer is controlling them) — face off against one another starting in opposite corners of the screen. The middle of the screen is littered with randomly positioned and coloured trees, two of which match the colours of the gunfighters.

The gunfighters can be moved in eight directions using the joystick, and can fire either left or right according to the direction the sprite is facing when the joystick button is pressed and held. Firing takes a moment — the bullet only comes out after a “draw and fire” animation has completed, so the button must be held until this is completed rather than “tapped”.

Collisions are detected using the entire (rather large) gunfighter sprite rather than a hitbox, so it’s possible to shoot your opponent in the “foot” or “hat” and still score a point. Shots also ricochet off the trees, with the background flashing the colour of the tree hit when this happens.

Each player has six shots per round, but can reload by touching the tree that is the same colour as their gunfighter. The game ends with a simple victory melody and colour-cycling screen when one player scores ten points — one of the few early Videopacs to feature an explicit victory sequence rather than simply freezing — then restarts immediately after this for another round.

		<desc>One or two players can play against the computer in this Blackjack game.

Each player starts with $1000. After placing their bets (through the keyboard), the dealer shuffles the cards and deals two face-up cards for each player and one face-up card and one face-down card to himself. He then asks the players to hit more cards or not (up to five). After each player has been dealt a full hand, the dealer reveals his face-down card. He'll take a hit if he has a total of 16 or less.

Blackjack or five cards without a bust pays double. The nearest to 21 hands pays even. No money is paid if there is a tie.

The computer offers an insurance bet if the dealer's first card is an ace. If the player accepts and the dealer goes blackjack, the player will lose no money. Otherwise, he will win or lose the current bet plus a half.

Sometimes the computer will also offer a double down. If the player accepts, the bet is doubled and he will get just one more card.

		<name>Morse (Europe)</name>
		<desc>Morse teaches the code to players. There are 4 types of games which can be selected in a menu screen:The first type is a Morse code learning game. The player selects the game speed (4 to 30 words per minute) and level (1 to all 36 characters available). The computer will play the Morse signal for the first symbol (Q) and the player has to type in the symbol. After learning two signals, the game starts properly by introducing a row of trees in the top of the screen. An arrow is also displayed near the 4th tree from the left and a man on the right side. For each 10 correctly responded symbols the man takes down one tree. When he reaches the arrow, a new symbol is introduced and the process starts over again. The sequence of symbols is: Q, 7, Z, G, 0, 9, 8, O, 1, J, P, W, L, R, A, M, 6, B, X, D, Y, C, K, N, 2, 3, F, U, 4, 5, V, H, S, I, T and E.

2. The second type lets the player type individual symbols and listen to their respective codes.

3. The third type is similar to the second one, but in this one the player types a sequence of symbols and then press "enter" to ask the computer to play the respective code.

4. In the fourth type the player uses the "action" button of the joystick to enter codes into and the computer plays them and shows the respective symbol entered.

		<desc>Variations
0, 1, 2, 3 – Standard Mazes: These four variations offer preset mazes for the game, in which the player character, the Munchkin, must eat all the Munchies (moving dots) on the screen, at which point the maze resets to its initial state and the game continues at a higher speed and difficulty. Three Munchers pursue the Munchkin and are fatal to the touch under normal circumstances. If the Munchkin eats a flashing coloured Munchie, the Munchers turn purple and can then be eaten by the Munchkin. More points are scored for each successive Muncher eaten before they return to their normal state.

4 – Random Maze: The game will randomly generate a maze for the game to unfold in.

5, 6, 7, 8 – Invisible Mazes: The game unfolds as usual, but the walls of the maze disappear when the Munchkin is moving.

9 – Invisible Random Maze: The game randomly generates a maze, which disappears from view when the Munchkin is moving.

P – Programming Mode: Starting from any of the predefined or randomly generated mazes, the user is able to completely customise their own level design by adding or deleting vertical and horizontal lines using a coordinate system.

		<name>Musician (Europe)</name>
		<desc>Musician is cartridge number 31 in the official Magnavox/Philips line of games for the Philips Videopac. It came in a cardboard box roughly double the size of a standard Videopac game box, containing a keyboard overlay in the style of a piano keyboard; the cartridge, in a standard Videopac box with a single sheet where the manual would usually be; and a landscape format manual, over double the size of a standard game manual.

The purpose of the set is to turn the user's Videopac into a musical keyboard. It supports recording and editing sequences of up to 81 notes, although there is no way to save apart from writing a composition down on music manuscript. In the manual there are the following pieces of sheet music:

"Badinerie" (Bach)
"Brother Jacob"
"The Entertainer"
"Eurovision Tune"
"Happy Birthday to You"
"Liebestraum" (Liszt)
"Lightly Row"
"Merrily We Roll Along"
"Michael Row the Boat Ashore"
"Mosocow Night"
"Old McDonald Had a Farm"
"This Old Man"
"Three Young Drummers"
"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"

		<name>Pairs / Space Rendezvous / Logic (Europe)</name>
		<desc>Variations

1 – Pairs (Solo): A single-player game of “Concentration”, played on a 5×4 grid, each cell marked with a letter. Players use the keyboard to select two cells, revealing the symbols contained within in the process. Finding a match between two symbols allows the player to immediately continue; failing to find a match causes a delay of a couple of seconds. The player is timed on how quickly they can find all the pairs.

2 – Pairs (Two-Player): A competitive variant on the above. The rules are the same, except when a player finds a pair they can continue their turn, whereas if they fail to find a pair play passes to their opponent. A score is kept of how many pairs each of the two players have found, and the game as a whole is still timed.

3 – Space Rendezvous: A two-player game with elements of Lunar Lander. Players control the thruster on their rocket ship with the fire button, and must land on the planet’s surface at the bottom of the screen, then launch again and be the first to dock with a pink mothership at the top of the screen to score a point. Crashing during landing causes a long delay, potentially allowing your opponent a chance to get ahead, but both players have severely limited fuel. The winner is the first to ten points.

4 – Logic: A simple number puzzle in which the player must type in a five-digit number, and the game tells them how many numbers they have got correct and in the correct position, and how many numbers they have got correct but in the wrong position. Using logical deduction, the player must determine the five-digit number the game decided on at the start of the game in as few moves as possible.

		<name>Race / Spin-Out / Cryptogram (Europe, US)</name>
		<desc>Variations

1 – Race: A simple, vertically scrolling racing game in the vein of Sega’s Monaco GP, though actually predating that game by a year. The player controls an orange car and must score as many points as possible within a two-minute time limit while avoiding white cars that “bounce” back and forth on the road. Colliding with a white car destroys the orange car and wastes time. Points are scored according to the speed the car is travelling. There are two skill levels; the second increases the maximum possible speed the orange car can travel and thus the maximum scoring potential in the two minutes available.

2 – Spin-Out, 3 Laps: A top-down racing game for two players. There are four skill levels, with higher levels increasing the complexity of the course with additional hazards. The cars are controlled by simply pushing the direction in which you wish to drive; there is no “turning”. The car’s speed can be increased by holding down the joystick button. Colliding with your opponent’s car causes you, them or both to spin out; colliding with a wall causes you either to spin out or destroy your car, wasting a few seconds before you respawn. The winner is the first player to complete three laps, and the game times the race.

3 – Spin-Out, 15 Laps: As above, but 15 laps instead of 3.

4 – Cryptogram: A word game for two players. The first player types in a word while the second averts their eyes. The game then scrambles the letters in the word and shows the second player the anagram. The second player must unscramble the word one letter at a time; the game will indicate when their guess for that letter is incorrect, and allow them to move on to the next letter only when they get one correct. Once the second player has unscrambled the word, the game indicates how many mistakes they made along the way.

		<desc>Dynasty! is an Othello clone. The playfield is an 8 x 8 matrix of dots and the objective is to occupy as much of it as possible. The game begins with two pieces of each color at the center of the matrix and players take turns placing new pieces in it. The pieces must be placed near to an enemy piece, trapping it between another piece of the same color already placed. Trapped pieces will turn over to the conqueror's color.
A variation is also present, called "Directional Dynasty": players cannot trap pieces in more than one direction with the same move. When a piece is placed in such condition, the player has to choose which direction will be used to capture the enemy's pieces.
A timer can be set, from unlimited time to 99 minutes of gameplay. The game ends when there are no more possible moves or when the time runs up.

		<name>Satellite Attack (Europe)</name>
		<desc>Variations

There are no variations for this game; hitting any key on the “SELECT GAME” screen takes you right into the action.

In Satellite Attack, you control a flying saucer-style spaceship as you attempt to fend off a storm of “asteroids”, represented by “X” and “+” characters alternating to represent them “spinning”.

Asteroids can be destroyed either by ramming them while a shield is visible around your ship, or shot down with a gun. The direction in which you fire gradually rotates clockwise around your ship as you move, stopping its rotation when it reaches the direction you are currently pushing on the joystick. Firing temporarily drops your shields, however, so you cannot ram an asteroid and fire at the same time.

If two asteroids collide, they become a “magnetic asteroid” which homes in on your ship. Enemy satellites sometimes appear and fly diagonally across the screen, firing a laser diagonally if the player crosses their path. These can be destroyed with the gun to score points, or avoided as they cross the screen.

Destroying asteroids that are close to each other causes chain reactions of explosions that score increasingly more points the more you chain together. Destroying the satellites is worth the most points of any individual action, but puts you at most risk.

Satellite Attack offers the ability to temporarily register your high score with a name of up to six characters. Resetting or removing the game loses this, however, as the cartridge has no means of permanently storing user data.

		<name>Space Monster (Europe, US)</name>
		<desc>Variations

There are no specific variations for this game — pressing any key at the “SELECT GAME” screen starts the game.

Space Monster is the Videopac take on Space Invaders — with a few interesting twists.

The player controls a large triangular laser cannon at the bottom of the screen. This can move left and right and fire up the screen. Above the laser cannon are three black squares that block shots in both directions. These are also used as “lives” of sorts — when the player’s laser cannon is hit, they become a small robot character and are vulnerable to defeat until they stand underneath a black square and press the fire button, at which point they will obtain a new laser cannon but lose the protection of the black square.

The alien forces consist of a row of green circular shields that cannot be destroyed, a row of yellow rocket launchers and a row of pink robots. The robots and rocket launchers move in sync with one another, while the shields move in a “staggered” way, allowing the player to fire through the gaps and hit their foes. All enemies alternate back and forth between two positions, and the formation as a whole gradually moves slowly from side to side and down the screen.

The alien forces are commanded by the titular Space Monster, who spends most of his time at the top of the screen, but occasionally swoops down to harass the player directly. When all of the pink robots have been defeated, the Monster also swoops down, and defeating him at this point rewards the player with a point. Conversely, the player being defeated while in “robot” form outside of the laser cannon rewards the Monster with a point. The first side to ten points wins; there is no other scoring mechanic.

		<name>Stone Sling (Europe)</name>
		<desc>Variations

1-3: All provide the same game, but with each increasing number the controls are more sensitive. At “1” you have to hold the joystick for quite a while to set power; at “3” you have a more fast-paced game in which the two players can sling stones more quickly.

Stone Sling is an artillery-style game in which two human players face off against each other in an attempt to destroy the other’s castle tower. Each player is armed with a catapult that can be fired by holding the joystick in any direction then returning it to centre, with the amount of time the direction was held determining the power and trajectory of the stone. There is no means of setting direction or moving your catapult, and there is no wind resistance — it’s all about the power, but there are no on-screen meters to assist.

Each player can hit three things on the other side: the castle tower (which damage it), their opponent’s catapult (which causes their opponent to wheel it away for repairs for a few seconds) or their opponent themselves (which causes them to disappear for a few seconds). There is also a river running through the middle of the play area, but this has no mechanical purpose, and is purely used for aesthetics and perhaps helping players to set their power with a visual reference point.

The game is over whenever one player or the other completely destroys the opposing castle tower, at which point the victorious player grows in size and is shown playing a trumpet, while the losing player is shown raising a white flag in surrender.

		<desc>In Super Bee the player controls a bee flying in a magic garden, where fruits keep popping everywhere. The fruits must be eaten (by flying over them), while avoiding to crash in the garden's fences (the edges of the screen). Additionally, when a fruit is eaten a magic barrier will appear, in the same direction in which the bee is flying, and it also must avoid crashing on them.

The player earns points by gathering fruits as follows:

1. Lemon (yellow): 5 points
2. Apple (red): 10 points
3. Pear (green): 15 points
4. Plum (grey): 20 points
5. Strawberry (red): 25 points

When the player reaches 105 points a bonus round takes place. A big spider appears in the screen, along with a fruit, for a limited time. Super Bee must avoid the spider and eat the fruit. By doing so the player earns 50 points. The next bonus rounds take place every 15 more points.

There are 10 skill levels available (by pressing 0 to 9), each one with different mazes.

		<name>Turtles (Europe)</name>
		<desc>Turtles, also known as Turpin, puts you into the role of the maternalistic turtle who tries to save the kidturtles from a bunch of bad bugs (or, in some versions, bad cars). It takes place in a Pacman-esque labyrinth, with turtle boxes in the centre and corners of the screen. Run into a box to release the turtle kid inside. Opening a box makes a little house show up, and you must go with the kidturtle to the house before you can release the next one. All the while, you must avoid the bugs/cars running around the maze. If they get too close, you can release a mine which will stun them temporarily. When you run out of mines, you must resupply by passing over a star in the centre of the screen. Beware, though, because the simpleminded bugs become smarter as time passes; this is symbolised by their changing colours. On later levels, those sneaky beetles can also come out of the boxes supposed to hold kidturtles. Watch out!

Each level is a floor in a house, and between levels you can see the turtle climbing to the next floor until it reaches the top.

		<desc>Type & Tell! lets the player type in a word or a message and then have the words spoken back to them by utilizing the Odyssey 2's voice module. The instruction manual suggests the following games that can be played: Garble! - Players take turns typing in one letter at a time, The idea is to form sentences by just using the sounds the individual letters make. Sound Waves! - Players type in random letters trying to create sounds that sound like something that could be heard in real life. Super Star! - Players can use the sounds or dialogue the game makes in their own home movie or radio show. War of Words! - This game requires at least two players. Player take turns typing in words until a sentence is created by one of the players adding a period. Players then take turns inserting words into the sentence, while trying to keep it grammatically correct. The first player to extend the sentence exactly to the end of the available typing space is the winner. If a player extends the sentence beyond the end of that available space, they lose.

You are in charge of the command posts at the edges of the city and need to defend it from the invaders. The various gorgon craft will keep flying by on the screen in varying numbers and in different flight patterns. At first they fly high in the sky but then progressively lower. If an enemy makes it low enough before you destroy it, it will use it's weapons and destroy one of the buildings in Atlantis. As you progress in the game, the enemy craft will keep increasing in speed. The game ends when all remaining buildings in the city have been destroyed.

		<desc>Your task in this arcade conversion is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen. Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made.

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away form their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.

		<desc>Your task in this arcade conversion is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen. Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made.

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away form their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.

		<desc>Popeye is a conversion of the arcade action/platform game. As Popeye, you are trying to win Olive Oyl's love! She is at the top of the screen dropping tokens of her love, and you need to collect them before they hit the ground. After you have collected the required number of items, you can move on to the next, more difficult level. There are many obstacles trying to stop you from completing your task, though! Brutus wanders around the screen and is constantly trying to catch you. If you collect a can of spinach, you can temporarily knock him out, otherwise Brutus will knock you out. Other objects such as bottles or birds are also flying around the screen and will cause you to lose one of your lives if you are hit. Each level features a different layout of platforms and ladders, and will have you collecting different items as they float towards the bottom of the screen!

		<name>Syracuse (France)</name>
				<desc>Syracuse recreates the Siege of Syracuse that took place during 214â€“212 BC, more specifically the battle which supposedly used the legendary weapon developed by Archimedes. The weapon, sometimes called "Archimedes heat ray" consisted in a mirror used to focus sunlight onto approaching Roman ships, setting them on fire.

This is a game for two players. One players controls Archimedes as he uses the mirror to reflect the sunlight at the Roman galleys. The other player controls the Roman galleys as they try to reach the base of the tower where Archimedes stands, to land troops at Syracuse. The galleys can catapult rocks to destroy Archimedes mirror in order to approach the tower without risk. The longer the player holds the button, the farther the rock goes; the rocks can also have its route altered during flight if the player moves the joystick up or down. If the mirror is broken, Archimedes can get a new one by leaving off the right side of the screen. Archimedes can move the mirror up or down to aim the reflection against one of the three approaching galleys. If a galley is hit twice by the sun light it will catch fire, and a new one will appear on the left side of the screen to replace it. The number of mirrors broken and galleys sunk is registered in the lower side of the screen.

Each game can last one whole day, from sunrise to sunset (8 minutes in real time). The sun rises in the left and sets in the right, and sometimes a cloud passes by, blocking some sun rays. The game can end in three ways: when the time runs out, when one player scores 99 points or when the three galleys reach the bottom of the tower. There are 4 game variations, with different sunbeam speeds, mirror position numbers, rock speeds and trajectory modification.

		<name>Interpol (Europe, prototype)</name>
		<desc>Interpol is a game for two players, one controls two spies (red characters) and the other controls two police officers (blue characters). The spies are in possession of secret information and must try to leave the country with them, by air or by sea. The police officers have to stop their plan. The airport and the port are blocked by the police, and individuals interested in traveling must present a code which only the police knows.

The main screen represents a town, with U-shaped boxes with numbers from one to nine inside representing buildings. At the beginning of the game, the player controlling the police must define the code which blocks the airport and port (represented by an airplane and a ship). The code must be a word of five letters. As the player enters each letter, he or she must assign a building to store that letter, by entering its number. Once all letters are stored, the game begins. The player controlling the spies must choose one of them and start moving around the town searching for the letters. While moving, the selected spy becomes invisible so the police officer won't see which way the spy takes. At one turn, movement can only be vertical or horizontal, so if the player chooses to move horizontally, he or she will only be able to move vertically in the next turn. At the bottom of the screen, a red character will be shown walking and little green bars will pass him by, telling how many "spaces" he has moved. Each turn may last five to 60 seconds, depending on the choice the players made at the beginning of the game (different durations can be set for each player). The turn ends when the time is over or when the player presses a button. The player controlling the police officers chooses one of them and starts moving, trying to catch the spies. When the player thinks the police character is in the same space the spy is, he or she must press the action button. If the spy is really there, he is captured, if not, the player controlling the police officers just ends his or her turn.

The game ends when the police captures both spies or when one of the spies gets to the airport or the port and enters the correct word.

		<name>Pinball! (US, prototype)</name>
		<desc>Pinball!, as the name implies, is a pinball game for one or two players. There are two game "formats". The main format has a table with 7 bumpers and two sockets, with two flippers at the bottom center. Holes at the bottom sides of the table are opened when the bumpers in the second line from bottom to top are hit. At first, hitting the bumpers adds 75 points to the score, but as the bumpers change colors when hit, the amount of points scored increase. The bumpers start red, then change to green, orange, dark blue, pink, light blue, white, black and then red again. The table can also be nudged by moving the joystick in the desired nudge direction. Each player has 5 balls to play. The second game mode allows players to design their own table by placing the 7 bumpers in any desired position. After placing all bumper, the game starts as usual.

		<name>Exojet+ (France)</name>
		<desc>In Exojet + the player controls a spaceship which has gone astray during a reconnaissance mission to an unknown planet and enters a canyon from which it cannot escape. The goal is to survive while defending the ship against two main threats: enemy space ships that fire while flying over the canyon sideways in the screen and laser guns in the canyon to intercept the ship. The player's ship has a sight which will change its position according to where the threat comes from, moving to the top of the screen for the enemy ships and to the front of the player's ship for the laser guns. The player's ship is also equipped with a magnetic shield which is destroyed if hit, but regenerates after six seconds.

After 10 enemies are destroyed, a spaceship base appears on the screen and the player must avoid destroying it. If the player touches the spaceship base, a bonus of 100 points will be granted, the magnetic shield takes half a second more to regenerate and the enemies become faster and better armed. In the beginning the enemies will fire single missiles, after the first base they'll fire groups of missiles, after the second they'll fire a "rain" of missiles and after the third they'll fire homing missiles. Further in the game, friendly ships will also appear and must not be destroyed.

After the player reaches 2000 points an enormous meteor may appear which can only be avoided (with a 100 points bonus for the feat). After 5000 points the speed of the meteor increases, as does the bonus points awarded (150). Finally, after 7000 points the ship loses its magnetic shield. The game is over if the ship is hit without its magnetic shield of if crashes in the canyon walls or the meteor.

		<name>Norseman (Europe)</name>
		<desc>In Norseman the player controls a Viking warrior trying to defend the magic Golden Viking Helmet.

The screen shows a courtyard divided in hexagons. The player has to protect the Golden Viking Helmet, which is at the bottom of the screen, from the attack of five different kinds of enemies. Each wave of enemies is composed of 5 of them. The enemies will appear in the top of the screen and will move toward the bottom of the screen; they can only move down (or diagonally down), and once they reach the bottom or the side of the screen they will reappear on the top or the opposite side. The Viking can move in all six directions, and will also reappear on the opposite side whenever he reaches the border. In order to attack, the Viking has to move inside the hexagon the enemy is in before the enemy moves against him first. As the enemies can only move downwards, approaching them from the 3 upper sides is advised.

When an enemy dies, the corpse remains in the hexagon, making it impossible to move through it. Well placed corpses can function as a trap for other enemies, as they can only move downwards. The player can also get trapped by surrounding corpses. Once all 5 enemies are dead, a new wave of enemies comes. Each new wave has different enemies, in the following order: giants, octopuses, dragons, skeletons and bats. Once all waves are beaten, the game restarts from the first wave in a greater difficulty, while retaining the player's score. If the player dies or the Golden Viking Helmet is stolen, the game is over.

The game has 10 variations:
Game 0: 1 helmet, monsters moving from top to bottom only.
Game 1: 2 helmets, monsters moving from top to bottom only.
Game 2: 3 helmets, monsters moving from top to bottom only.
Game 3: Same as game 0, but this time the Viking warrior can only attack a monster when it appears in flashing, bright red.
Game 4: As game 1, but this time the Viking warrior can only attack a monster when it appears in flashing, bright red.
Game 5: As game 2, but this time the Viking warrior can only attack a monster when it appears in flashing, bright red.
Game 6: 1 helmet, monsters will come from all directions: two monsters moving from top to bottom, and one each from left to right, from right to left and from the bottom to the top. Monsters can stumble onto one single dead colleague and thus commit suicide.
Game 7: Same as game 6, but with 2 helmets.
Game 8: As game 6, but with 3 helmets.
Game 9: This variety combines all handicaps of the previous nine varieties: 3 helmets, monsters coming from all directs and the flashing red monsters.

		<desc>It's the year 8048 and mankind has been anhialated. The nncomputers and machines that were built to help man have nnbecome smart enough to rule over - and eventually destroy - nnall civilization. Now, the once united machines have fractured, nnand the machines have begun battle with each other. Two nnfactions remain. Each side has a CPU master and six robot nnwarrior servants. The CPUs can't move, so the robots are sent nnout to do the dirty work. The goal: shutdown the opposing nnside's CPU. Many obstacls are in place to prevent this: the nnother robots, energy surges, firewalls, viruses, and the CPU's nnown laser defenses. 

Ted Szczypiorski has done it again! Mr. Roboto! is an absolute nnmasterpiece. A clever mix of Archon and Tron Deadly Discs, nnyou can play against the CPU, against another player, or let nntwo CPUs duke it out. Fast-paced and addicting, Mr. Roboto! nnfeatures three game screens, intro and menu screens, and is nnvoice enhanced. It just doesn't get any better than this!
